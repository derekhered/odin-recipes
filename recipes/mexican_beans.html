        <ol><strong>Steps</strong>
            <p></p>
            <li>Slice up your bacon strips into small pieces. If using oil instead of bacon, 
                just place 2tbps. in a pan on medium heat and skip to step 3.</li>
            <li>Heat your pan on medium-high, cook the bacon pieces, stirring until
                crisp and brown. </li>
            <li>While the bacon is cooking, slice up your onion and peppers.</li>
            <li>Remove the individual bacon pieces from the pan, leaving the fat in it still.</li>
            <li>Sear your peppers and onions in the pan with the bacon fat until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Once the veggies are cooked, mix the can of beans with it, with the liquid. 
                Stir for 3-4 mins.</li>
            <li>Place your chicken stock in with the veggies</li>
            <li>Turn heat down to low, let simmer for 15-30 mins or until the stock has thickened.</li>
            <li>Serve however you'd like, and enjoy!</li>
